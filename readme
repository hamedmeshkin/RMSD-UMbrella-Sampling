The simulation cannot be submmited automatically but nothing needs to be changed, the scripts will take care of every thing by itself.
The following caution should be considered unless something went wrong.

If one simulation was killed, in order to run it again, just delete the output folder corespond to the simulation job number.
If one needed to keep the data related to the killed job, just log file and sim.job.restart.tcl file will need to be updated for new simulation. "sim3.log"
has to be changed to sim3_"sumulation job Number".log

For submmiting the first job use regular qsub command, but for the other jobs dependency qsub is needed: 
qsub -W depend=afterany:'last job_ID' sim_ext.pbs

sim.job.restart.tcl file in the main directory must be checked after each simulation for any inconsistency.
